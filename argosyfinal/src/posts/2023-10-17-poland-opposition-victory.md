Large crowds gathered in Warsaw's Castle Square on election night October 15, as captured in images broadcast by Polish and international media outlets. Young and old, urban professionals and rural teachers, they had come to celebrate what many viewed as a democratic revival—the peaceful defeat of the Law and Justice Party that had governed Poland for eight increasingly controversial years.

By midnight, the electoral mathematics were clear. The opposition alliance led by Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition had secured 248 seats in the 460-member Sejm, sufficient to form a government. Law and Justice, despite remaining the largest single party with 194 seats, had lost its governing majority and with it, power.

Record turnout of 74.4% demonstrated that Polish voters understood the significance of their choice. This wasn't merely another election—it was a referendum on democratic institutions themselves.

The result sent reverberations across Europe, where populist parties had seemed ascendant and democratic backsliding appeared increasingly common. In Poland, at least, that trajectory had been reversed.

## Democracy as Campaign Issue

The opposition's victory emerged from years of growing resistance to Law and Justice policies that had systematically challenged judicial independence, press freedom, and women's rights. The 2020 near-total abortion ban became a particular catalyst, sparking massive protests that evolved into sustained political organization.

According to European media reports, women played a crucial role in mobilizing opposition voters. The abortion restrictions had galvanized female participation across age groups, creating a political force that Law and Justice couldn't effectively counter through its traditional appeals.

Tusk, the former European Council President who had governed Poland from 2007 to 2014, returned to domestic politics with a straightforward message: restore democracy. His Civic Coalition promised to reverse judicial "reforms" that had given politicians control over courts, end state media propaganda, and rebuild relationships with European partners.

The campaign revealed deep divisions in Polish society, as documented by Polish polling organizations. Law and Justice voters viewed their party as defending traditional Catholic values and Polish sovereignty against European interference. Opposition supporters saw the election as a final opportunity to preserve democratic institutions from complete capture.

## Law and Justice's Miscalculations

Despite presiding over strong economic growth and implementing popular social programs like the 500+ child benefit, Law and Justice found itself consistently on the defensive throughout the campaign. The party's conflicts with EU institutions had frozen billions in development funds that Poland needed for infrastructure and modernization.

Party leader Jarosław Kaczyński's attempts to mobilize conservative voters through anti-LGBT rhetoric and warnings about European interference appeared to backfire with moderate voters. The economic benefits of EU membership remained overwhelmingly popular, according to Polish public opinion surveys, and voters proved unwilling to sacrifice prosperity for cultural symbolism.

European media reported that Law and Justice also suffered from internal divisions and corruption scandals that emerged during the campaign. Allegations of state power abuse for partisan purposes undermined their claims to represent clean governance and national renewal.

## Coalition Challenges Ahead

The opposition's victory required unprecedented cooperation among parties with significant ideological differences beyond their shared opposition to Law and Justice. Tusk's Civic Coalition will govern alongside the centrist Third Way alliance and the left-wing Lewica party—a coalition spanning from conservative liberals to social democrats.

This diversity could complicate governing, as these parties maintain different positions on economic policy, social issues, and the pace of democratic reforms. However, their shared commitment to restoring rule of law provides initial unity around institutional changes.

According to Polish constitutional experts quoted in local media, coalition governments can face stability challenges, but the strong shared commitment to democratic restoration should provide cohesion around core institutional reforms. The real tests will come when they need to make difficult economic decisions that may divide coalition partners.

## European Relations Reset

Poland's democratic renewal removes a major source of tension within the European Union and creates opportunities for enhanced cooperation. The new government has promised to implement rule of law reforms necessary to unlock frozen EU funds, potentially providing billions for infrastructure and green energy projects.

European leaders welcomed the election results enthusiastically, as reported by EU media outlets. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated the opposition victory, while German and French officials expressed optimism about improved bilateral cooperation.

The change also affects broader European dynamics. Hungary's Viktor Orbán, who had developed close ties with Law and Justice leaders, now faces isolation as his main regional ally moves toward democratic restoration and European integration.

## Security Policy Continuity

Despite dramatic domestic political change, Poland's security and defense policies will likely remain consistent with established approaches. Both government and opposition parties support strong NATO commitments, robust defense spending, and continued aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia.

Poland's role as a frontline state in supporting Ukrainian resistance enjoys broad bipartisan support, according to Polish foreign policy experts quoted in local media. The new government may actually enhance this role by improving coordination with European partners and restoring diplomatic relationships damaged under Law and Justice.

The opposition's victory may also strengthen Poland's position within NATO by resolving tensions over democratic governance that had complicated alliance relationships, particularly with the United States and Western European members.

## Institutional Restoration

The new government inherits significant challenges beyond basic institutional reform. Poland's economy faces inflation pressures, labor shortages, and the need to transition toward green energy while maintaining industrial competitiveness. Managing these economic pressures while implementing political reforms will test coalition unity.

Judicial reform will prove particularly complex, requiring careful balance between restoring independence and avoiding political backlash. The opposition has promised to reverse Law and Justice's judicial changes, but this process involves legal and political complications that could generate new controversies.

According to Polish legal experts quoted in academic publications, managing voter expectations will be crucial for the new government's long-term success. Citizens want rapid change, but democratic restoration inevitably requires gradual, careful processes to ensure sustainability.

## Democratic Victory's Broader Significance

Poland's election demonstrated that populist authoritarianism is not inevitable and that democratic movements can successfully mobilize against institutional capture. The record turnout showed that voters remain committed to democratic values when presented with clear choices about institutional direction.

The victory provides hope for democratic movements in other countries facing similar challenges from populist parties seeking to capture state institutions. It demonstrates that even well-entrenched populist governments can be defeated through sustained organizing and coalition-building.

European democracy experts noted that Poland's democratic comeback strengthens the broader European project and provides evidence for democratic resilience in the face of authoritarian challenges that have emerged across the continent.

As Donald Tusk prepares to return as Prime Minister, he faces the challenge of translating electoral victory into effective democratic restoration. The high turnout and clear mandate provide strong foundations, but the complexity of reversing eight years of institutional changes requires sustained political commitment.

The celebration in Castle Square marked the beginning of a democratic restoration project whose success will influence not only Poland's future, but also the broader trajectory of European democracy in an era of increasing authoritarian challenges.
