    <h2>Letter from the Editor-in-Chief</h2>
    <p>
      When we launched <em>The Argosy</em>, our aim was simple but ambitious: to give students a real newsroom—
      a place where ideas, stories, and debate could flourish. We wanted to create more than just a school paper.
      We wanted a forum where curiosity meets craft, where sharp reporting and thoughtful essays live side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I hope this publication grows into a trusted voice for our community and beyond:
      a place readers turn to for clear-eyed reporting, for context that matters, and for writing
      that sparks conversation long after the browser tab is closed. I want <em>The Argosy</em> to be a
      training ground for young journalists and a permanent fixture in the cultural life of our school.

      None of this happens by accident. It takes late nights of editing, endless drafts,
      photo shoots in the rain, and the quiet persistence of a dedicated team.
      To every writer, editor, designer, photographer, and to the organizations and mentors who
      support us—thank you. Your talent and grit give these pages their heartbeat.
