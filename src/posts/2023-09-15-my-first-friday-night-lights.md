  In Korea, school is for studying. At Bulloch Academy, I'm learning that on
  Friday nights, the entire town's classroom is the football stadium.

When I first arrived in Statesboro, Georgia, for my homestay, people told me I needed to learn about a few key things to understand the South: sweet tea, the importance of saying "ma'am," and Friday night football. The first two were easy enough to understand. But the football part was a puzzle. In Korea, a high school's identity is built on academic rankings and university acceptance rates. The idea that a whole town would shut down to watch a group of teenagers play a game seemed strange.

So, on a warm Friday night in early September, I went to my first Bulloch Academy Gators football game. I thought I was going to watch a sporting event. I quickly realized I was attending something much closer to a town-wide festival, a family reunion, and a church service all rolled into one.

The first thing I noticed was the sound. Long before I could see the field, I could hear the marching band. It wasn't just a few songs; it was a constant, energetic soundtrack for the whole evening. Then came the sights: the entire community was there. Grandparents sat in foldable chairs they must have been using for decades. Parents, wearing jerseys with their sons' numbers on the back, paced nervously along the fences. Little kids in tiny cheerleader outfits ran around with maroon-and-gold painted faces, chasing each other with a seemingly endless supply of energy.

In Korea, community often revolves around family or church. Here, it felt like the entire community was one big family, and the stadium was their living room.

The game itself was exciting, full of impressive plays and dramatic moments. But what I found most fascinating was watching the people. I saw how a great catch by a wide receiver could bring a thousand people to their feet in a single, unified roar. I saw how a missed field goal could create a collective groan of shared disappointment. There was a sense of shared identity here that was incredibly powerful. The successes and failures of those teenage boys on the field were, in a very real way, the town's successes and failures.

At halftime, the band put on a show that was more intricate and practiced than some professional performances I've seen. The student section had coordinated chants for every possible situation. It was a display of immense school spirit, something that goes far beyond just academics.

I came to the game expecting to be an outsider, a quiet observer of a strange American ritual. I left feeling like I had been welcomed into something important. I still have a lot to learn about the rules of football, but I'm starting to understand the rules of a Southern Friday night. It’s not just about winning or losing. It's about showing up. It’s about being part of something bigger than yourself, under the bright lights of a small-town stadium.
