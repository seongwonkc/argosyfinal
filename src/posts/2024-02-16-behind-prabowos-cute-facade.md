Politics in the TikTok era is a strange and often surreal business. Case in point: Prabowo Subianto, the next president of Indonesia. His campaign wasn't defined by fiery speeches or detailed policy papers. It was defined by a clumsy, endearing dance that turned him into a viral sensation and a beloved, grandfatherly figure nicknamed "Gemoy," or "cute and chubby."

It’s a brilliant piece of political branding. And it’s utterly terrifying if you know who Prabowo Subianto actually is.

This is a man who was, for years, banned from entering the United States due to his alleged role in human rights abuses as a special forces commander under the Suharto dictatorship. He is a former son-in-law of that same dictator. In two previous, losing presidential campaigns, he was the fiery nationalist, the strongman who railed against the West and questioned the legitimacy of democracy itself.

So how did the menacing general become the dancing grandfather?

Two things happened. First, he was brought in from the cold by the man who beat him twice, the incredibly popular outgoing president, Joko "Jokowi" Widodo. After their bitter 2019 contest, Jokowi shrewdly appointed Prabowo as his Defense Minister, a move that pacified the opposition and mainstreamed a controversial figure.

Second, Jokowi made it clear that Prabowo was his chosen successor. And to seal the deal, Prabowo chose Jokowi’s own son as his vice-presidential running mate. This required a last-minute, highly controversial court ruling from a judge who happened to be Jokowi’s brother-in-law. It was a move of such audacious nepotism that it has raised serious questions about a new political dynasty in a country that fought so hard to escape its authoritarian past.

The Prabowo-Jokowi ticket was a political masterstroke. It allowed Prabowo to campaign on a simple message: continuity. He promised to continue Jokowi's popular infrastructure projects and economic policies. With the beloved Jokowi's son literally by his side, the message was clear: a vote for me is a vote for more of the man you already love.

And it worked. Prabowo won in a landslide.

Now Indonesia, and the world, is left with a deeply uncomfortable question: which Prabowo will show up to govern? Will it be the pragmatic statesman who promises to continue the stable, pro-growth policies of his predecessor? Or will it be the general from the old days, the one with a disdain for dissent and a deep connection to the country's authoritarian establishment?

The dancing is over. The real test of what Indonesia has just elected is about to begin.
