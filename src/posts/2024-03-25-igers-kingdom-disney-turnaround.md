When Bob Iger returned to the CEO position at The Walt Disney Company in late 2022, he was hailed as a returning king, the steady hand needed to right a ship that had gone adrift. In the years since, his second tenure has been anything but a fairytale. It has been a brutal, high-stakes battle to navigate a company grappling with a streaming business that is bleeding cash, a declining traditional television empire, and a fierce proxy battle with an activist investor.

The story of Iger's turnaround effort is a fascinating case study in modern corporate strategy, a microcosm of the immense challenges facing all legacy media companies in the age of digital disruption.

**The Streaming Money Pit**

The most significant challenge facing Iger is the one he helped to create: the streaming wars. In his first tenure, Iger launched Disney+ to compete directly with Netflix, a move that was initially seen as a brilliant success, attracting hundreds of millions of subscribers. But the "growth at all costs" strategy came with a staggering price tag. The service has lost billions of dollars, a massive financial drain that has become the central focus of Wall Street's concern.

Iger's new strategy is a painful but necessary pivot from chasing subscribers to chasing profitability. This has involved a series of difficult moves:
* **Price Hikes:** The company has aggressively raised the price of its ad-free streaming tiers, a gamble that consumers are willing to pay more for premium content.
* **Content Purge:** In a move that was once unthinkable, Disney has removed dozens of shows and movies from its streaming services to save on residual and hosting costs.
* **Reduced Output:** The firehose of expensive content, particularly from the Marvel and Star Wars universes, is being slowed down in favor of a "quality over quantity" approach.

The goal is to make the direct-to-consumer business profitable by the end of 2024, a goal on which Iger has staked his reputation.

**The War with Nelson Peltz**

As if the streaming challenge were not enough, Iger has also had to fight off a costly and distracting proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and his Trian Fund Management. Peltz, arguing that Disney's stock has underperformed and that the company lacks a coherent succession plan, has been fighting for seats on the company's board.

This is a classic activist investor playbook. By publicly criticizing the company's management and strategy, the activist hopes to win the support of other large institutional shareholders and force the company to make changes that will, in their view, unlock shareholder value. Iger and the Disney board have been forced to spend millions of dollars and a significant amount of their time fending off this challenge, a battle they ultimately won in April 2024, but which served as a major distraction.

**What is the Future of Disney?**

Beyond the immediate crises, Iger is facing a set of profound, long-term strategic questions. What is the future of its traditional television assets, like ABC and ESPN, in an era of cord-cutting? Can the movie studios, particularly Pixar and Marvel, recapture their creative magic after a series of box office disappointments? And, most importantly, who will succeed the 74-year-old Iger when his contract expires?

The challenges facing Disney are immense. Iger's second act is not about building a new empire, but about restructuring and perhaps even shrinking an old one to fit a new media reality. It is a turnaround story that is still in its early chapters, and its outcome will have a profound impact on the future of the entire entertainment industry.
