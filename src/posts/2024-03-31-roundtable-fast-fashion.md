*Editor's Note: Welcome to our monthly roundtable discussion. Each month, our five student editors will come together to debate a major issue shaping our world. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.*

**Saerom Kim:** I want to talk about something that's a huge part of our generation's life: the rise of ultra-fast fashion. Companies like SHEIN and Temu have become absolute behemoths by offering an endless stream of trendy clothes for astonishingly low prices. I'm really interested in the psychology of it. It feels less like traditional shopping and more like a slot machine. They use gamification, countdown timers, and a constant flood of new products. It feels designed to be addictive.

**Anthony Min:** It's absolutely designed to be addictive, and it's a brilliant business model. Let's be clear about what they've done. They've taken the traditional fashion cycle, which used to be seasonal, and compressed it into a matter of days. They use AI to scrape social media for emerging trends, and their hyper-agile supply chain in China can turn a design into a product in under two weeks. They don't have physical stores, so their overhead is low. And they've perfected a model of using micro-influencers to market their products for almost nothing. From a purely business perspective, it is a ruthlessly efficient machine.

**Saerom Kim:** But what is the cultural cost of that machine? As someone who loves fashion, it feels like it's completely devaluing the idea of personal style. It's not about developing a unique look anymore; it's about endlessly chasing the micro-trend of the week. The "haul" video has become a genre of its own, where the goal is to show off a massive quantity of clothing that will probably be worn once for a TikTok video and then thrown away. It creates a culture of disposability that is really troubling.

**Yehee Jung:** The environmental and health side of that disposability is terrifying. The fashion industry is already one of the world's biggest polluters, and this model puts that on hyperdrive. We're talking about massive water consumption, the use of cheap, synthetic fabrics that shed microplastics with every wash, and the abysmal labor conditions that are necessary to produce a shirt that costs less than a cup of coffee. It feels like a system that is offloading its immense environmental and human costs onto the parts of the world that we don't see.

**Minwoo Jung:** This is where the political dimension comes in. The rise of these companies is a story about the new realities of global trade. They have been able to exploit a trade loophole in the US, the "de minimis" rule, that allows them to ship packages valued under $800 directly to consumers from China without paying tariffs. This gives them a massive, state-subsidized advantage over domestic retailers who have to pay those tariffs. It's a geopolitical issue that has huge implications for the future of retail in the West.

**Anthony Min:** That's a key point, Minwoo. They are not competing on a level playing field. But you also have to ask, why is it so successful? Because it's providing consumers with what they want: incredible variety at an incredibly low price. It's easy to critique the model, but it's meeting a very real market demand, especially among young people who don't have a lot of disposable income.

**Saerom Kim:** But is it a "real" demand, or is it a manufactured one? That's the psychological question. The platform's entire design—the constant novelty, the variable rewards, the social proof from influencers—is engineered to create a feeling of perpetual dissatisfaction. It makes you feel like you're always one purchase away from being happy or on-trend. It's not just meeting a demand; it's creating a constant state of wanting.

### Final Thoughts

**Yonghyuk Choi:** Every sports team has a jersey that's supposed to last a season; fast fashion has created a world where a jersey's 'season' might only be one weekend.

**Anthony Min:** These companies are a masterclass in supply chain efficiency and exploiting regulatory loopholes; you have to respect the ruthlessness of the business model.

**Saerom Kim:** It's a culture that replaces personal style with a relentless, disposable trend cycle, and I think we'll regret what we've lost.

**Yehee Jung:** The environmental and human cost of a five-dollar shirt is not on the price tag; it's being paid by the planet and by garment workers we'll never meet.

**Minwoo Jung:** The success of SHEIN and Temu is a story about a massive loophole in global trade policy that has put Western retailers at a huge disadvantage.
