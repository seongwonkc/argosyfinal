***Editor's Note:*** *The question of a domestic nuclear weapons program, long a fringe topic in South Korean politics, has entered the mainstream discourse. As global security dynamics shift, we asked two of our editors to make their strongest case for and against this monumental step. The following are their opening arguments.*

### The Case for a Nuclear South Korea
**By Minwoo Jung**

Let us dispense with the pleasantries of diplomatic idealism and speak in the language of power, for it is the only language our adversaries truly understand. For seventy years, South Korea has outsourced its ultimate security guarantee to Washington. This arrangement, while fruitful, is no longer sufficient for a 21st-century middle power facing an existential threat. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not merely a rogue state; it is a nuclear-armed rogue state with an explicit constitutional mandate to communize the entire peninsula. To believe that a "denuclearization" fantasy is still possible is to be willfully blind.

The strategic calculus is brutally simple. A non-nuclear state cannot reliably deter a nuclear-armed one. The American nuclear umbrella, while still potent, is subject to the political whims of Washington. Can we be certain that a future American president, faced with the choice of sacrificing San Francisco to save Seoul, would make the choice in our favor? To even ask the question is to reveal the fundamental weakness of our position. Strategic ambiguity is a luxury we can no longer afford.

Developing a domestic nuclear deterrent is not an act of aggression; it is the ultimate act of self-preservation. It would fundamentally alter the strategic landscape of Northeast Asia, forcing both Pyongyang and Beijing to recalculate. It would elevate South Korea from a security dependent to a true sovereign, capable of defending its national interests without seeking permission. The risks are significant—international sanctions, a regional arms race—but the risk of inaction is annihilation. A South Korean bomb is not about starting a war, but about ensuring one never begins.

### The Case Against a Nuclear South Korea
**By Yehee Jung**

The argument for a nuclear South Korea is seductive because it is simple. It appeals to a primal desire for strength and absolute security. But this simplicity masks a catastrophic and deeply irresponsible gamble that would endanger our nation, our region, and the planet. The pursuit of nuclear weapons is a path of no return, and one that history shows leads not to security, but to a permanent state of high-stakes terror.

First, the immediate consequences would be devastating. South Korea would face crippling international sanctions, shattering our export-driven economy. Our pursuit would violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), making us a pariah state and providing a green light for Japan, Taiwan, and others to follow suit, triggering a domino effect of proliferation that would make the world infinitely more dangerous. The dream of strategic autonomy would be a nightmare of economic isolation and regional instability.

Second, the environmental and public health risks are unacceptable. Where would we test these weapons? Where would we store the highly toxic radioactive waste for the required tens of thousands of years? Our densely populated peninsula has no room for error. A single accident at a weapons facility would be a national catastrophe on a scale that would make Fukushima look minor.

Finally, the strategic argument is a fallacy. Nuclear weapons do not guarantee safety; they create a "balance of terror" where the slightest miscalculation could lead to Armageddon. The current system of extended deterrence, backed by the formidable power of the United States, has successfully kept the peace for decades. The solution to North Korea's threat is not to mimic its madness, but to strengthen our alliances, invest in advanced conventional defenses, and pursue relentless, clear-eyed diplomacy. To build our own bomb is to accept the logic of our enemy and, in doing so, lose the very soul of the peaceful, prosperous, and globally-respected nation we have built.
