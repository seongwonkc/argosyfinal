***Editor's Note:*** *From antitrust lawsuits against Google to concerns about the impact of social media on teenage mental health, the power of major technology companies has become a subject of intense global debate. Are these companies innovative engines of growth or unregulated monopolies that require government intervention?*

### The Case for Regulation as a Social Necessity
**By Hannah Ryu**

To frame the debate over Big Tech as a purely economic one is to miss the fundamental nature of their power. Companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon are not just businesses; they are the architects of our social and informational reality. Their products are specifically engineered to capture our most valuable resource—our attention—and the consequences for our mental health and social fabric are too severe to be left to the whims of the market. Regulation is not a matter of economic policy; it is a matter of public health and safety.

From a psychological perspective, the business model of many of these companies is based on exploiting cognitive vulnerabilities. Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, using intermittent variable rewards to keep users scrolling. Recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube can lead users down rabbit holes of extremist content, not out of any ideology, but simply because that content is highly engaging. The documented rise in anxiety, depression, and body image issues among teenagers is directly linked to their use of these platforms.

These companies have also become the de facto regulators of our public square, with the power to amplify or silence voices on a global scale. This is a level of power over speech that we would never entrust to a government, yet we have allowed it to be wielded by private, for-profit companies with little transparency or accountability. Just as we regulate food and drug safety, or the safety of our cars, we must regulate the safety of these digital products. This means enforcing algorithmic transparency, strengthening data privacy laws, and holding platforms accountable for the harmful content they amplify. This is not about stifling innovation; it's about ensuring that innovation serves humanity, not the other way around.

### The Case Against Stifling Innovation
**By Anthony Min**

The call to regulate Big Tech is a classic example of a solution that is worse than the problem. It is driven by a romanticized fear of size and a fundamental misunderstanding of the dynamic nature of the technology market. While these companies are large, they are not the unassailable monopolies of the past, and heavy-handed government intervention would do more to stifle innovation and entrench incumbents than it would to protect consumers.

The tech industry is characterized by "creative destruction." Today's giants are constantly under threat from the next wave of innovation. Myspace was once a dominant social network. Yahoo was once the king of search. The market, if left alone, is a far more effective regulator than any government bureaucracy. The immense profits these companies make are the reward for taking massive risks and creating products that billions of people choose to use. These profits are then reinvested into the research and development—like AI and cloud computing—that drives the next wave of economic growth.

Government regulation, by contrast, is a recipe for stagnation. It would create a complex web of rules that would be difficult for startups to navigate, effectively creating a "moat" that protects the very companies the regulation is meant to target. Would a small startup be able to compete with Google's army of lawyers and compliance officers? Of course not.

The social problems my colleague highlights are real, but they are not problems that can be solved by clumsy government regulation. The solution lies in competition, consumer choice, and cultural adaptation. We should focus on fostering a vibrant, competitive market where new companies with better, safer products can challenge the incumbents. We should empower users with more control over their data and their algorithms. To invite the government to regulate the fast-moving world of technology is to ask a horse and buggy to set the speed limit for a sports car. The result will be a traffic jam that benefits no one.
